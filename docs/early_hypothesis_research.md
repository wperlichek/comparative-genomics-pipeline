# What am I asking?

## Primary Question

**Do rare or subtle variants in evolutionarily conserved regions of DEPDC5 lower seizure threshold under environmental stressors (dehydration, sleep deprivation), causing localized seizures in otherwise unaffected individuals?**

## Follow-up Questions

**Where exactly do those variants occur and why do they occur?**

**Can we find any evidence of this in other vertebrate species too?**

**How does this compare to SCN1A if at all?**
