# Early Hypothesis Research: Environmental Trigger Variants in DEPDC5

## Core Hypothesis

**Primary Question:** Do rare or subtle variants in evolutionarily conserved regions of DEPDC5 lower seizure threshold under environmental stressors (dehydration, sleep deprivation), causing localized seizures in otherwise unaffected individuals?
