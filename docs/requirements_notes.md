# Comparative Genomics Pipeline for Epilepsy-Related Ion Channels

## ðŸ§  Phase 1: Define Scope & Collect Data

### âœ… Step 1. Define Research Scope

**Ion Channel Gene:**
A gene that encodes a protein forming an ion channel â€” a pore in a cell membrane that selectively allows charged ions (such as sodium, potassium, calcium, or chloride) to pass in and out of cells. Ion channels are essential for generating electrical signals in nerve and muscle cells.

**Neuronal Excitability**
The ability of a neuron to fire an electrical signal (action potential) in response to stimulation. It reflects how easily a neuron "gets excited" to send messages. Neuronal excitability depends on the balance of ion flow across the neuronâ€™s membrane through ion channels.

**Converved Region**
A segment of a protein or gene sequence that remains highly similar or identical across different species over evolutionary time, indicating its important functional or structural role.

**Divergent Region**
A segment of a protein or gene sequence that shows significant variation between species, often reflecting adaptations, less critical function, or evolutionary change.

_Early question_: If someone is epileptic, is there a mutation in a conserved or divergent region, or both, and why?

## Top 5 Epilepsy-Related Genes to Study

| Gene Symbol | Protein Type                             | Notes                                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SCN1A**   | Voltage-gated sodium channel Î± subunit | Key gene linked to Dravet syndrome and other epilepsy forms.                           |
| **KCNQ2**   | Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit| Involved in neonatal epilepsy; regulates neuronal excitability.                       |
| **SCN2A**   | Voltage-gated sodium channel Î± subunit | Associated with early-onset epilepsy and developmental issues.                        |
| **CACNA1H** | T-type voltage-gated calcium channel   | Implicated in generalized and childhood absence seizures.                            |
| **GABRA1**  | GABA_A receptor subunit Î±1 (chloride channel) | Important for inhibitory signaling; mutations linked to epilepsy.                    |
