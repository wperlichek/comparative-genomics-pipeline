# Comparative Genomics Pipeline for Epilepsy-Related Ion Channels

## Project Overview

This pipeline enables modular, reproducible comparative genomics analysis of epilepsy-associated ion channel genes across a broad range of species. It integrates public gene/protein datasets, multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree building, conservation scoring, human variant mapping, and visualization. The project is under active development, with a focus on expanding species coverage, improving analysis, and supporting scientific interpretation.

## Current Capabilities

- Fetches orthologous protein sequences for selected genes (SCN1A, KCNQ2, SCN2A, CACNA1H, GABRA1) from UniProt and NCBI for human, rabbit, chicken, and lamprey (with easy extension to more species).
- Performs multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using EBI Clustal Omega API.
- Builds phylogenetic trees from unaligned FASTA files.
- Computes conservation scores (Shannon entropy, consensus) for each MSA and outputs results as CSV and PNG.
- Fetches and maps human disease variants from UniProt onto conservation plots.
- Fetches 3D protein structures (PDB) for selected genes.
- Modular design: easy to add new genes, species, or analysis steps.
- Markdown documentation and progress logs for scientific transparency.

## Planned/Upcoming Features

- Generalize variant/conservation overlay for all genes and species.
- Add/expand unit tests, code linting, and static analysis for code quality.
- Expand and polish documentation for public/academic use.
- Add support for more model and non-model organisms (e.g., reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates).
- Integrate 3D structure visualization and mapping of variants onto structures.
- Enable cloud/DevOps support (e.g., AWS, Docker, Nextflow) for scalable, reproducible runs.
- Summarize research findings, plan further research, and write scientific conclusions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- pandas
- biopython
- matplotlib
- httpx
- (optional) jupyter, seaborn, scipy, requests, tqdm

Install with:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage Notes

- Not yet battle-tested for public useâ€”expect quirks and rough edges. More details, tips, and polish coming soon.
- To clear all pipeline output data:

```bash
rm -f ./data/output/*/*
```

- Input species/genes are currently configured in `data/input/genes_to_proteins.json`. To focus on a subset (e.g., human, rabbit, chicken, lamprey), edit this file accordingly.
- All data and results are under active analysis; interpretation is ongoing.

## Scientific Context

The lamprey has been extensively studied because its relatively simple brain is thought in many respects to reflect the brain structure of early vertebrate ancestors. Comparing ion channel genes and epilepsy-associated variants across human, rabbit, chicken, and lamprey provides insight into the evolutionary conservation and divergence of these genes, and may help identify when seizure susceptibility first emerged in vertebrate evolution.

## ðŸ§  Phase 1: Define Scope & Collect Data

### âœ… Step 1. Define Research Scope

**Ion Channel Gene:**
A gene that encodes a protein forming an ion channel â€” a pore in a cell membrane that selectively allows charged ions (such as sodium, potassium, calcium, or chloride) to pass in and out of cells. Ion channels are essential for generating electrical signals in nerve and muscle cells.

**Neuronal Excitability:**
The ability of a neuron to fire an electrical signal (action potential) in response to stimulation. It reflects how easily a neuron "gets excited" to send messages. Neuronal excitability depends on the balance of ion flow across the neuronâ€™s membrane through ion channels.

**Conserved Region:**
A segment of a protein or gene sequence that remains highly similar or identical across different species over evolutionary time, indicating its important functional or structural role.

**Divergent Region:**
A segment of a protein or gene sequence that shows significant variation between species, often reflecting adaptations, less critical function, or evolutionary change.

> *Early question:*
> If someone is epileptic, is there a mutation in a conserved or divergent region, or both, and why?

## Top 5 Epilepsy-Related (Human) Genes to Study

| Gene Symbol | Protein Type                                   | UniProt Accession | Notes                                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SCN1A**   | Voltage-gated sodium channel Î± subunit         | `P35498`          | Key gene linked to Dravet syndrome and other epilepsy forms.      |
| **KCNQ2**   | Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit        | `O43526`          | Involved in neonatal epilepsy; regulates neuronal excitability.   |

### âœ… Step 2. Collect Orthologous Protein Sequences

> *Question:*
> I need to select species other than humans to compare with. How do I decide which species to select? Should I just select randomly?

> *Answer:*
> Do **not** select randomly â€” we want to select for biologically meaningful coverage across the evolutionary tree.

**Guidelines for species selection:**

* Span vertebrates and invertebrates
* Vary in nervous system complexity
* Have good sequence availability

#### Example group-level selection:

* Mammals
* Birds
* Reptiles
* Amphibians
* Bony Fish
* Insects
* Nematodes
* Cephalopods
* Jawless Vertebrates

---

**Orthologous Genes:**
Genes that evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation and generally perform the same function.

> *Question:*
> With the diversity of groups we've selected (insects, nematodes, etc.), are we sure that the epileptic genes we've selected will be found in all of them, e.g., will it be an orthologous gene in this group?

> *Answer:*
> No, it is possible these genes won't be present in some groups. However, knowing which groups lack these genes can provide insight into the research.

**Keep in mind when selecting species:**

1. **Start with well-studied model organisms:**

   * Well-annotated genomes and proteomes available
   * Widely used in research with abundant data and tools
   * Representative of the taxonomic group and relevant to neuroscience/evolution

2. **Check ortholog availability:**

   * Use NCBI Gene, Ensembl, OrthoDB to confirm gene orthologs exist
   * Avoid species with missing or poorly annotated orthologs

3. **Consider evolutionary distance and biological relevance:**

   * Include both close relatives (fine differences) and distant relatives (to find conserved regions)
   * Select species with interesting traits linked to your research question

4. **Verify data quality:**

   * Prefer species with high-quality reference genomes and protein data
   * Avoid species with incomplete or low-quality sequence data

### Final selection (species level):

* Sourced from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
* Choosing proteins for later Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) â€” proteins are more "obviously" informative than DNA sequences for this research project
