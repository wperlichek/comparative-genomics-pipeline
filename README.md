# Comparative Genomics Pipeline

**Bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing evolutionary conservation of epilepsy genes across vertebrate species.**

Built a complete async Python pipeline that pulls data from 5 genomic databases (UniProt, NCBI, EBI, ClinVar, PDB), performs multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, then maps clinical variants to conserved regions. 

**Tech:** Python async/await, AWS S3 caching, Docker, 118 tests, multiple API integrations

**Results:** Generated phylogenetic trees and conservation plots for SCN1A and DEPDC5 genes across 5 species, showing 90% conservation in key functional regions.

**Pipeline:** Ortholog retrieval â†’ Multiple sequence alignment â†’ Phylogenetic analysis â†’ Conservation scoring â†’ Variant mapping

## Research Focus

**SCN1A (Dravet Syndrome):** Voltage-gated sodium channel predominantly expressed in GABAergic interneurons. Loss-of-function variants impair interneuron firing, reducing GABA release and causing network disinhibition leading to hyperexcitability and seizures.

**DEPDC5 (Focal Epilepsy):** DEP domain-containing protein 5, part of the GATOR1 complex that regulates mTOR signaling. Mutations cause focal cortical dysplasia and familial focal epilepsy with variable foci, affecting neural development and excitability through mTOR pathway dysregulation.
