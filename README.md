## 🧬 Epilepsy Ion Channel Comparative Genomics Pipeline

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Explore how epilepsy-related ion channel genes have evolved across species using foundational comparative genomics tools.

> 🧪 *Built as part of my transition into computational biology, this pipeline integrates public gene/protein datasets with practical bioinformatics techniques to enable early-stage, cross-species analysis of epilepsy-associated genes.*

### 🚀 Pipeline Flow  
`Fetch orthologs → Align sequences → Build phylogenetic trees → Score conservation → Map human variants → (Optional) Visualize in 3D → Store & run on AWS`

## 🚦 Data Sources

- **UniProtKB**: For protein sequences and human variant annotations
- **NCBI Entrez**: For additional protein orthologs
- **EBI Clustal Omega**: For multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree generation
- **RCSB PDB**: For 3D protein structure files (PDB)


📁 **Requirements:** [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md)

### Running locally

> ⚠️ Not battle-tested for public use yet—expect quirks and rough edges. More details, tips, and polish coming soon.

```BASH
pip install -e .
comparative-genomics-pipeline
```

#### Clear existing data

```BASH
rm -f ./data/output/*/* # clear all pipeline output data
```

### 🐳 Running with Docker

You can run the entire pipeline in a containerized environment using Docker:

```BASH
# Build the Docker image (run from project root)
docker build -t comparative-genomics-pipeline .

# Run the pipeline in a container, mounting your local data directory
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data comparative-genomics-pipeline
```

This will ensure all outputs appear in your local `data` directory, just as with a local run.

### Current Status

6/24/25 —  
Collected orthologous protein sequences for 5 key genes using NCBI and UniProt APIs; saved in `data/output/orthologs`.
Ran multiple sequence alignments (MSAs); results are in `data/output/msa`.  
Next up: figuring out how to actually interpret these alignments—reading up on best practices for MSA analysis before moving on to phylogenetic tree building, analysis WIP at `/data/results/msa/SCN1A_msa.md`

6/25/25 —  
Debugged the EBI Clustal Omega API integration for both MSA and tree generation. Did some hands-on analysis of the resulting trees and alignments, jotting down observations and questions in `/data/results/trees/trees_from_msa.md` and `/data/results/msa/SCN1A_msa.md`.

6/25/25 (later) —  
UniProt variant extraction is working now. All annotated human protein variants for SCN1A are being pulled (others possible too). Output is in `data/output/variants/P35498_variants.csv`. Next up: try to overlay these variants on alignments/conservation plots.

6/26/25 —  
Mapped human protein variants onto conservation scores for SCN1A and created a worksheet to help interpret the results (`/data/results/variants/conservation_variant_map.md`). Fetched and saved 3D protein structure for SCN1A (P35498) from RCSB PDB as a PDB file named with both accession and PDB ID.

6/26/25 (later) —  
Added orthologs and analysis for additional model organisms (reptiles, amphibians, bony fish, insects, nematodes, cephalopods, jawless vertebrates) across all pipeline steps. Worksheets and outputs now reflect this expanded set. Next: analyze the impact of these new groups before moving on to DevOps/cloud (AWS) integration.

6/26/25 (latest) —
- Dockerfile is now running and ready for AWS ECR integration.
- Discovered a bug: some UniProt IDs returned 404 errors, leading to a data update. Need to revisit assumptions about sequence availability and ID validity.

It's notable that lamprey, though evolutionarily distant from humans, shows little branch length difference for SCN1A in the phylogenetic tree. SCN1A is highly conserved across vertebrates, but it's unclear if lampreys experience seizures or if disease-causing variants have similar effects in all groups.

6/27/25 -

- Scaled down the pipeline to focus on a single gene (SCN1A) and three mammals: human (*Homo sapiens*), mouse (*Mus musculus*), and monkey (*Macaca mulatta*) for initial validation and data quality. This minimal set will help ensure robust, realistic comparative genomics before expanding to more genes or species.

## 📊 Sneak Peek: Example Outputs

Below are sample outputs **generated by this pipeline**:
