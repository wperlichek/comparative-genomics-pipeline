# üß¨ Comparative Genomics Pipeline for Epilepsy Ion Channel Analysis

**A Python-based bioinformatics pipeline demonstrating computational biology skills through real-world genomics data integration and analysis.**

## üéØ Project Overview

This pipeline performs comparative genomics analysis of epilepsy-related ion channel genes (primarily SCN1A) across multiple species. It integrates data from public repositories, performs evolutionary analysis, and maps human disease variants to conserved regions.

**Key Scientific Question:** How have epilepsy-associated ion channel genes evolved across species, and where do human disease variants fall within conserved functional domains?

## üî¨ Technical Approach

**Pipeline Architecture:**
```
Data Retrieval ‚Üí Sequence Alignment ‚Üí Phylogenetic Analysis ‚Üí Conservation Scoring ‚Üí Variant Mapping ‚Üí Visualization
```

**Core Technologies:**
- **Python 3.9+** with async/await for concurrent API calls
- **Biopython** for sequence analysis and bioinformatics operations
- **Docker** for containerized, reproducible execution
- **REST API Integration** with UniProt, NCBI, and EBI services
- **Scientific Computing** with NumPy, matplotlib for data analysis and visualization

**Data Sources:**
- **UniProtKB**: Protein sequences and human variant annotations
- **NCBI Entrez**: Additional orthologous sequences
- **EBI Clustal Omega**: Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic trees
- **RCSB PDB**: 3D protein structure data


## üö´ Current Development Status

**Honest Assessment:** This is an active learning project showcasing my transition into computational biology. The pipeline successfully demonstrates:

‚úÖ **Working Components:**
- Multi-API data integration (UniProt, NCBI, EBI)
- Asynchronous Python programming patterns
- Docker containerization
- Scientific data processing and visualization
- Real biological data analysis with SCN1A gene

‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Limitations:**
- Limited to proof-of-concept scale (3 species, 1 gene)
- Lacks comprehensive error handling and input validation
- No automated testing suite yet
- Configuration currently hardcoded
- Documentation is developer-focused rather than user-focused

**AI Assistance:** I've used Claude AI for code review, architectural suggestions, and debugging complex async operations. This collaboration helped me learn best practices while maintaining scientific accuracy.
