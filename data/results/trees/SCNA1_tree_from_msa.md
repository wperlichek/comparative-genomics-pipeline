# Phylogenetic Tree Analysis Worksheet: SCN1A

### Phylogenetic Tree Analysis

1. **What major clades or groupings are observed in the tree?**
   [Describe the main branches or clusters and which species are grouped together.]

2. **Are there any unexpected relationships or placements in the tree?**
   [Note any species that cluster differently than expected based on known biology.]

3. **How well supported are the branches (if support values are available)?**
   [Comment on branch support/confidence if shown in the tree.]

4. **Do the treeâ€™s groupings match known evolutionary relationships?**
   [Compare your tree to published phylogenies or accepted taxonomy.]

5. **What might explain any discrepancies or surprises in the tree?**
   [Consider alignment quality, sequence selection, or biological phenomena.]
