# Phylogenetic Tree Analysis Worksheet

**Note:** These are *preliminary* results intended to build confidence in the pipeline and are not final conclusions.

### Phylogenetic Tree Analysis

1. **What major clades or groupings are observed in the tree?**
   Grouping: Human and rabbit are grouped together. Chicken usually its own group. This makes sense as
   human/rabbit are mammals and chickens are birds. 

2. **Are there any unexpected relationships or placements in the tree?**
   No. We see GABRA1 SCN2A and SCN1A have rabbit/human close and chicken far horizontally, which is intuitive. 
   CACNA1H and KCNQ2 the chicken is closer to human/rabbit horizontally. 
   On a high level, we would expect some proteins to diverge and some to be conserved depending on evolutionary constraints.

3. **How well supported are the branches (if support values are available)?**
   N/A Clustal Omega does not have branch support. Need to use IQ-Tree if we wanted this. 

4. **Do the treeâ€™s groupings match known evolutionary relationships?**
   Yes, mostly. The chicken is a bird that diverged from mammals so we
   expect to see distance from rabbit and human.

5. **What might explain any discrepancies or surprises in the tree?**
   The KCNQ2.png suggests this protein is highly conserved across human,
   rabbit, and chicken. Other genes show more obvious evolutionary
   distance.
