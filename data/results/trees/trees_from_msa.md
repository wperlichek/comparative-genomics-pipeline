# Phylogenetic Tree Analysis Worksheet

**Note:** These are *preliminary* results intended to build confidence in the pipeline and are not final conclusions.

### Phylogenetic Tree Analysis

1. **What major clades or groupings are observed in the tree?**
   [Describe the main branches or clusters and which species are grouped together.]

2. **Are there any unexpected relationships or placements in the tree?**
   [Note any species that cluster differently than expected based on known biology.]

3. **How well supported are the branches (if support values are available)?**
   

4. **Do the treeâ€™s groupings match known evolutionary relationships?**
   Yes, mostly. The chicken is a bird that diverged from mammals so we
   expect to see distance from rabbit and human.

5. **What might explain any discrepancies or surprises in the tree?**
   The KCNQ2.png suggests this protein is highly conserved across human,
   rabbit, and chicken. Other genes show more obvious evolutionary
   distance.
