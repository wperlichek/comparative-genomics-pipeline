# Conservation and Variant Mapping Worksheet: SCN1A (Beginner Friendly)

---

## 1. What am I looking at?
- **What does this plot show?**
  It's a graph overlays two different results: conservation of sequence and variants. 
  
  Conservation is in blue and it is how conserved a sequence is among three species - human, rabbit. and chicken. A lower blue line means lower entropy thus highly conserved.

  The variant is in red - this is based only on human.

- **What is the protein or gene being studied?**
  [Write the name, e.g., SCN1A.]

---

## 2. Conservation (How similar are the sequences?)
- **Where do you see high points or low points in the plot?**
  [Are there areas where the line is very high or very low?]

- **What might a high point mean? What about a low point?**
  [Guess: Does high mean more similar? Low mean more different?]

---

## 3. Variants (Changes in the sequence)
- **Where are the dots or markers for variants?**
  [Are they spread out or do they cluster in certain areas?]

- **Do any variants fall in the high (conserved) regions?**
  [Circle or list a few.]

- **Do any variants fall in the low (variable) regions?**
  [Circle or list a few.]

---

## 4. What could this mean?
- **Why might it matter if a variant is in a conserved region?**
  [Take a guess: Would a change in an important (conserved) part of the protein be more likely to cause problems?]

- **What questions do you have about this plot?**
  [Write down anything youâ€™re unsure about or want to ask.]

---

## 5. Next Steps & Notes
- **What would you like to learn next about this data?**
  [Ideas: Look up what the protein does, check if any variants are linked to disease, etc.]

- **Anything that surprised you?**
  [Write a quick note.]
