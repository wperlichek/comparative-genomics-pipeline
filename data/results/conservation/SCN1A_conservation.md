# Conservation Score Analysis Worksheet

**Note:** These are preliminary results to help interpret conservation across aligned sequences.

## Basic Info

1. **What gene(s) is this analysis for?**
   SCN1A

2. **Which species are included in the alignment?**
   [List species]

3. **How were conservation scores calculated?**
   Shannon entropy per alignment column, consensus residue (see pipeline documentation for details)

## Conservation Results

4. **Which regions are most highly conserved?**
   [List position ranges with lowest entropy or highest consensus]

5. **Which regions are most variable?**
   [List position ranges with highest entropy or lowest consensus]

6. **Are there any notable patterns in conservation (e.g., domains, motifs, or functional sites)?**
   [Describe any patterns, e.g., conserved domains, variable loops, etc.]

7. **Do conserved regions correspond to known functional or structural domains?**
   [Yes/No/Partially, and elaborate]

8. **Are there any regions with missing data or gaps that affect conservation scores?**
   [Describe any such regions]

## Interpretation

9. **What might explain the observed conservation/variability?**
   [Evolutionary constraints, species-specific adaptations, etc.]

10. **How might these results inform further analysis or experiments?**
    [e.g., focus on conserved regions for mutagenesis, map variants to conserved/variable sites, etc.]
