# MSA Analysis Worksheet

### Basic Info

1. What gene(s) am I analyzing? **CACNA1H, GABRA1, KCNQ2, SCN1A, and SCN2A**
2. Which species are included in this alignment? **So far, Homo sapiens, Oryctolagus cuniculus, and Gallus gallus** 
3. What tool(s) did I use to create the alignment? **Clustal Omega from European Bioinformatics Institute (REST API)**

### Ortholog Data

4. Do I have UniProt or Entrez Protein IDs for all sequences? **Yes**
5. Are there any missing IDs or sequences that I need to find or update? **No**

### Alignment Quality

6. Which parts of the alignment look highly conserved (similar or identical across species)?
7. Are there regions with many gaps or insertions? Where exactly (positions)?
8. Do any sequences show suspicious large insertions or deletions compared to others?

### Biological Insight

9. Are the highly conserved regions associated with known functional domains or motifs?
10. Could any gaps or insertions correspond to exon/intron boundaries or species-specific features?

### Alignment Reliability

11. Are there regions that look poorly aligned or contain many mismatches?
12. Should I consider trimming these regions before further analysis?

### Next Steps for Analysis

13. What tool or method should I use for trimming (if needed)?
14. Which phylogenetic tree-building tool do I want to try first?
15. Do I need to re-run the alignment with different parameters or additional sequences?

### Reflection & Notes

16. What surprised me or stood out when viewing the alignment?
17. What questions or uncertainties do I have about this alignment?
18. What files or screenshots do I want to save for reference?
